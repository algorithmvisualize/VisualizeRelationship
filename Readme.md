## Readme

### Preliminary

```
python: 3.10
```

Please make sure you have installed the following libraries:

```bash
flask
PyQt6
PyQt6-WebEngine
requests
flask-cors
webbrowser
```

> You can also find the dependencies in the `requirements.txt `file.

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Usage

Firstly, this is a `client-server` architecture. Before starting any other programs, make sure that `start_server.py` has been launchedï¼Œ run

```bash
python start_server.py
```

In `client.py`, we prepared 8 cases to visualize our relation map, respectively, 

```
test_graph1
test_graph2
test_graph3
test_graph3_pos
test_graph3_neg
test_graph1_multi
test_graph2_multi
test_graph3_multi
```

As the name suggests, for each of the three graphs, we have prepared both single-data and multiple-data versions. Graph 3, due to its positive and negative sentiment, has three variations.

For visualization, simply run any function of unit_test in `client.py`.

> Note: The visualization part utilizes PyQt. Due to limitations with threads, we have opted for a multiprocessing approach to display the visualized images. Therefore, if you intend to run all test units directly from `client.py`, you need to consider the configuration of your local machine in advance.

### Visualization example

#### Right clicking

Right-clicking the mouse, you will find three types of options: **Save**, **Refresh**, and **Browser**.

"Save" option saves the currently generated image to the default location (takes a screenshot), `E:\code\python` is absolute parent directory for the project.

"Refresh" option is to regenerate the current page. Please note that this will disrupt all your position adjustments.

"Browser" option is to generate your image in your system default browser.

#### Graph1

Here is the visualization 1 for data in Appendix. As you can see, the program automatically generated an image, trying its best to avoid collisions. However, in reality, there are still some overlapping contents.

In fact, our nodes and relationship content can be automatically dragged into position. You can adjust them to a visually pleasing layout.

#### Graph2

Only internal nodes with `POS`, `NEG`, `NEU` relationships between entities within the cluster can be dragged, while the cluster as a whole can be dragged.

Graph3

Internal nodes can all be dragged, and at the same time, scrolling the mouse wheel over the innermost circle can adjust its radius. NEG and POS can be dragged as a whole.
